# DatabasesAssignment1pt2
part 2 of the first databases assignment in SETU's hDip in Computer Science. 
This assignment tasked us with taking our conceptual and logical models and generating a database from them in mySQL complete with a variety of views, triggers, users etc.
This database is based on my current work-place, a music and art school and features a mock dataset that adheres to the criteria outlined in the tables.
Script 1 creates the database, its triggers, views etc and inserts the data.
Script 2 features a number of queries to demonstrate certain assignment requirements.
